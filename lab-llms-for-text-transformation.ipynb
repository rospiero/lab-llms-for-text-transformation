The plush is incredibly soft and cute, and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems like a manufacturing flaw rather than intentional design. While I found the plush to be a bit smaller than expected given the price, I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. Despite this, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it myself before passing it on to my daughter. Overall, it's a delightful gift that brings joy to both children and adults alike."
